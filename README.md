## Overview
This project showcases the usage of machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes on the Titanic dataset.
The combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection through cross-validation ensures an ideal performance evaluation.

The project implements a supervised learning flow on the Titanic dataset, which is divided into training and testing sets. The goal is to classify survival outcomes using machine learning techniques.

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Visualizing data to understand patterns and relationships.
- Performing feature engineering to create meaningful features for modeling.

2. Model Training:

- Using various classification algorithms such as KNN and Naive Bayes to train models.
- Using 5-fold cross-validation with grid search to select optimal hyperparameters.

3. Evaluation:

- Assessing model performance on the test set to demonstrate its quality.
- Evaluating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools and Techniques

- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Techniques: Supervised learning, feature engineering, cross-validation, grid search, etc'
